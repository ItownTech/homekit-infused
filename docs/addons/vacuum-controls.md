![Homekit Infused](../images/vacuum-controls-preset.png)

### Description
This is a card that has a few preset buttons to control your vacuum cleaner. It will has some nice effects as well. When the vacuum is turned on, the play button will turn green and blink, the same is true for pause and stop! cool huh?

### Configuration
- To use this you must have a vacuum entity setup (e.g. Xiaomi Roborock)
- If you use a Xiaomi Roborock and have Valetudo, I will suggest connecting your vacuum with the default miio integration in HA as well (they will both function at the same time)
```
# example configuration.yaml
vacuum:
  - platform: xiaomi_miio
    host: 192.168.0.xx
    token: !secret roborock_token
```
